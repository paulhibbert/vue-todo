# vue-todo

## Basic todo app using Vue JS

Dependencies: [Vue-Draggable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable) and [SortableJS](https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable) as well as Vue. Use button styling from [Purecss](https://purecss.io/buttons/).

I found that sortable JS has to be loaded before Vue and then Vue draggable otherwise it does not work.

Icon from [feathericons](feathericons.com).

## Description

I started with [the Todo MVC on the official website](https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/todomvc.html) but wanted to change the functionality a little bit for personal use. Like the original it uses localStorage to store a list of tasks and if marked as done the text of the task is struck through. The code is not as complex as the original.
